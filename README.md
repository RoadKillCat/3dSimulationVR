### NOTICE:

**The end of the evolution of this entire project was a complete JavaScript library called `zengine.js`. I have [a seperate repository](https://github.com/joeiddon/zengine/) hosting that, so if you want to see my best code, explore there.**

---

My goal was to simulate a 3d world in the browser from complete scratch. This repository holds all of my revisions of the code to do so.

---

Why simulating 3d is so simple and how to do it (i.e. an explanation of this code) can be found on my website [here](https://joeiddon.github.io/projects/javascript/simulating_threed).

---

The files are versioned by the number following the `v` and those with `x2` in their names are designed to work on a phone in a VR headset. The only exception to this scheme is `3dv2vr` which was an attempt to render the two eyes for virtual reality on one canvas (which I realised was inferior to using two canvases - arranged with css).

---

To save downloading the whole repo, I setup GitHub pages to host all the versions. Just follow the links to see the evolution! (controls are `WASD` for movement, `ZX` for up down, `QE` for looking left and right and `RF` for looking up and down)
